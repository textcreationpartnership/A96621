            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whereupon his Excellency immediatly di≈øpatched a Letter to the Hou≈øe of Commons, a Copy whereof followeth:</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Was ≈øent unto the King on Fryday la≈øt, to de≈øire the Parliament to give way to him to ≈øee his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; And that they might for that purpo≈øe be ≈øent to him, If I may be bold humbly to offer my opinion, I think the allowance of ≈øuch a thing may be without the lea≈øt prejudice to the Kingdom, and yet gain more upon his Maj. then denying it; and if it be in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of every good man, that his heart may be gained, the performance of ≈øuch civilities to him is very ≈øuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to tho≈øe de≈øires, and will hear well with all men, who (if they can imagine it to be their own ca≈øe) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ≈øorry, if his Maj. naturall affection to His Children, in ≈øo ≈ømall a thing ≈øhould not be complyed with; and if any que≈øtion ≈øhould be concerning the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance of their return, I ≈øhall ingage for their return within what time the Parliament ≈øhall limit.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:160369:3"/>
               <p>Upon this occa≈øion, give me leave, I be≈øeech you, to take notice of ≈øome reports ≈øpread abroad, as if my ≈øelfe, and the Officers of the Army were upon ≈øome under hand contract, or bargain with the King; and from thence occa≈øion is taken to ≈ølander our integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and endeavour a mi≈øunder≈øtanding betwixt the Parliament and their Army, the fidelity of which to the Parliament and Kingdom, and their affection to it, are the great objects of many mens Envies, becau≈øe they ≈øee nothing ≈øo likely to ≈øettle Right and Freedom with Truth and Peace to Us and Po≈øterity, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their De≈øignes again≈øt the ≈øame, as an harmony or good accord between the Parl. and Army, which is the joy of good men, and it ≈øhall be our ≈øtudy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve again≈øt all De≈øigns and De≈øigners to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To prevent therefore all mi≈øunder≈øtandings of that kind, I thought with all clearne≈ø≈øe to declare unto you, That we have done nothing, nor ≈øhall doe any thing, which we de≈øire to hide from you or the world or ≈øhall not avow to the faces of our greate≈øt Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaries. Our De≈øires concerning a ju≈øt con≈øideration or ≈øettlement of the Kings Rights (his Maje≈øty fir≈øt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his concurrence to ≈øettle and ≈øecure the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdome) we have already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely declared in our Repre≈øentation and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrance. Since the fir≈øt of tho≈øe Papers ≈øent unto the Parl. there haue been ≈øeverall Officers of the Army upon ≈øeveral occa≈øions ≈øent to his Maje≈øty, the fir≈øt to pre≈øent to him a Copy of the Repre≈øentation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ≈øome others to tender him a Copy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrance; upon both which, the Officers ≈øent were appointed to clear the ≈øence and intention of any thing in either Paper, whereupon his Maj. might make any
<pb facs="tcp:160369:4"/>que≈øtion. Since then, there have al≈øo been ≈øome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers at ≈øeverall times ≈øent to his Maje≈øty about His remove from <hi>Hatfield,</hi> to di≈ø≈øwade (if po≈ø≈øibly) from <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> or any place ≈øo neare <hi>London,</hi> to ≈øome place of further di≈øtance, an≈øwerable to what we had de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>In all which addre≈ø≈øes to his Maje≈øty, We care not who knowes what hath bin ≈øaid, or done; for as We have nothing to bergain for or aske, either from His Maje≈øty or the Parl. for advantage to our ≈øelves, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular party or intere≈øt of our own, ≈øo in all tho≈øe addre≈ø≈øes to his Maje≈øty, we have utterly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and di≈øavowed any ≈øuch thing, But the onely intent and effect of tho≈øe our addre≈ø≈øes hath beene, to de≈øire his Maj. free concurrence with the Parlament, for e≈øtabli≈øhing and ≈øecuring the common Rights and Liberties, and ≈øetling the Peace of the Kingdom; and to a≈ø≈øure him, that (the Publique being ≈øo provided for, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that as we had publikely declared for the ≈øame in generall termes, ≈øo (if things came to a way of ≈øettlement we ≈øhould not be wanting (in our ≈øphaeras) to one that generall de≈øire, in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of naturall or civil right to his Maj. Per≈øon or Family, which might not prejudice, or again indanger the Publique: and in the mean time, that his Maje≈øty ≈øhould find all per≈øonall civilities and re≈øpects from us, with all rea≈øonable freedom that might ≈øtand with ≈øafety, and with the tru≈øt or charge lying upon us concerning his per≈øon.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:160369:4"/>
               <p>You have here the utmo≈øt fum of what hath pa≈ø≈øed from us to his Maje≈øty; and we could wi≈øh all men did rightly under≈øtand (without mi≈ørepre≈øentation) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular wherein (as we know nothing not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Rea≈øon, Ju≈øtice, Hone≈øty or Con≈øcience, ≈øo we thought our ≈øelves concerned the rather to ≈øay &amp; do, as we have towards his Maje≈øty ≈øince he came within our quarters, becau≈øe of tho≈øe common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ≈øugge≈øted again≈øt us, as if we were utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Monarchy, and all civill Order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And for that particular of the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and the two Chaplaines lately permitted to attend his Maje≈øty, it was not done without much reluctancy, becau≈øe therein we doubted we might be mi≈øunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood by the Kingdoms be≈øt friends.</p>
               <p>But upon his Maje≈øties continuing importunity for it (as a thing very nearly concerning his inward &amp; outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentment; and conceiving tho≈øe per≈øons ≈øu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In generall Wee humble conceive, that to avoid al har≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes and afford all kinde u≈øage to his Maje≈øties Per≈øon in things con≈øi≈øting with the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom is the mo≈øt chri≈øtian Honourable and prudent way, Wee think that tendor equitable and moderate dealing both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Maje≈øtie, his Royall Family, and his late party,
